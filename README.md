# files-panel

This widget provides a simple interface for browsing and uploading files in an Artifact repository. It can be embedded inside an `ArtifactFrameHolder` and communicates with the surrounding environment through the Artifact client.

## Development

npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Open `dist/index.html` in an `ArtifactFrameHolder` to display the panel.
